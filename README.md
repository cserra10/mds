# Material Design System
This project uses material-ui, storybook, rollup and other tools to create an enterprise design system for your own 
frontend applications.

By using this boilerplate you will be able to:

- Develop many themes as you need. Start creating light, dark, christmas, etc themes using our `@mds/themes` app.
- Start creating your own react component library using our `@mds/ui` boilerplate. Then you can publish it to your private npm repository.
